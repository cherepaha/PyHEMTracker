# PyHEMTracker
PsychoPy- and PyGaze-based tool for mouse- and eye-tracking decision making experiments with random dots stimulus

Dependencies:
-NumPy
-PsychoPy
-PyGaze

If you want to specify some parameters of psychopy's DotStim in degrees of visual angle instead of pixels, 
you also need to install psychopy's MonitorCenter. In MonitorCenter, you have to create a profile for the monitor 
you use for stimulus presentation, and specify the display parameters in constants.py
